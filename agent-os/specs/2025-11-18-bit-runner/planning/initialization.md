# Bit Runner - Initial Description

## Raw Idea from Roadmap

**Item 10:** Fourth Game: Bit Runner — Implement endless runner game with pixel character, dev-themed obstacles (compilers, bugs, brackets), distance tracking, and theme-aware visuals `L`

## Description

Bit Runner is an endless runner game where:
- Player controls a pixel character that runs continuously
- Obstacles are dev-themed (compilers, bugs, brackets)
- Game tracks distance traveled as the score
- Visuals are theme-aware (adapts to current theme)
- Character runs automatically, player controls jumping/ducking
- Game ends when player hits an obstacle
- Score is based on distance traveled

## Initial Notes

- Endless runner mechanics (character runs automatically)
- Dev-themed obstacles for developer aesthetic
- Distance-based scoring system
- Theme integration for visual consistency
- Simple controls (jump/duck to avoid obstacles)
