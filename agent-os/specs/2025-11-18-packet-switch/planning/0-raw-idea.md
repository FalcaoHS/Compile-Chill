# Raw Idea: Packet Switch

## User Description

**Original Request:**
"Tenth Game: Packet Switch — Create routing logic game where players direct packets, with network particle animations, theme integration, and score tracking"

## Context

This is the tenth game in the roadmap (item 19), following the completion of previous games like Terminal 2048, Dev Pong, Bit Runner, Hack Grid, Debug Maze, Refactor Rush, and Crypto Miner Game. The user wants a routing logic game that:

- Players direct packets through a network
- Features network particle animations
- Integrates with the theme system
- Includes score tracking

## Initial Notes

- Routing logic game mechanics (directing packets)
- Network-themed gameplay
- Particle animation effects for network traffic
- Theme-aware styling (must work with all 5 themes)
- Score tracking and submission to API
- Should follow the same pattern as other games in the project
