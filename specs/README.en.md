## 🤖 Development with Agent OS

This project was developed using **[Agent OS](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os)**, a system for better planning and execution of software development tasks with AI agents.

### What is Agent OS?

**Agent OS** transforms AI programming agents from "confused interns" into productive developers. With structured workflows that capture your patterns, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, Agent OS provides your agents with the specifications needed to deliver quality code on the first attempt—not the fifth.

**Official repository**: [https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os)
