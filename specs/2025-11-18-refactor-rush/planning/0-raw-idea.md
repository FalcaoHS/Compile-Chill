# Raw Idea: Eighth Game - Refactor Rush

## User Description

**Original Request:**
"Eighth Game: Refactor Rush — Implement puzzle game where players reorganize 'code blocks' to clean files, with particle effects on moves, theme integration, and score tracking `M`"

## Context

This is the seventeenth feature in the roadmap, following the completion of previous games and core infrastructure features. This is the eighth game implementation.

The game should be:
- A puzzle game where players reorganize "code blocks" to clean files
- Particle effects on moves
- Theme integration (integrates with theme system)
- Score tracking
- Server-side validation to prevent score manipulation

## Initial Notes

- Based on puzzle/refactoring mechanics
- Players reorganize code blocks to clean/refactor files
- Visual feedback with particle effects when making moves
- Should use theme tokens for styling
- Score should be tracked and saved
- Game state validation is critical for preventing cheating
- Should be playable with keyboard and touch controls
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
